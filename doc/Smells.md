# CS 1440 Project 4.0: Refactoring - Code Smells Report

## Instructions

Edit this file and include it in your submission.

For each code smell found in the starter code:

*	Note where you found it (filename + relative information to locate the smell)
    *   You do not need to list code smells in any particular order
*	Describe the smell and why it is a problem
*	Paste up to 10 lines of offensive code between a triple-backtick fence `` ``` ``
    *   If the block of bad code is longer than 10 lines, paste a brief, representative snippet
*	Describe how you can fix it
    *   We will follow up on these notes to make sure it was really fixed!
*   At least *one instance* of each smell is required for full marks
    *   Reporting one smell multiple times does not make up for not reporting another smell
    *   Ex: reporting two global variables does not make it okay to leave spaghetti code blank



## 10 Code Smells

If you find a code smell that is not on this list, please add it to your report.

0.  **Magic** numbers
    *   These are literal values used in critical places without any context or meaning
    *   "Does the `256` right here have anything to do with the `256` over there?"
1.  **Global** variables
    *   Used to avoid passing a parameter into a function
    *   Used to return an extra value from a function
    *   There are better ways to meet both of these needs!
    *   *Note, this does not apply to global `CONSTANTS`!*
2.  **Poorly-named** identifiers
    *   Variable names should strike a good balance between brevity and descriptiveness
    *   Short variable names are okay in some situations:
        *   `i` or `j` as a counter in a brief `for` loop
        *   Variables from well-known math formulae should match the textbook (i.e. `a`, `b` and `c` are familiar in a quadratic or Pythagorean formula)
        *   Otherwise, short names should be avoided
    *   Variables with really, really long names make code harder to read
    *   Variables that override or "shadow" other identifiers
        *   Builtin Python functions such as `input`, `len`, `list`, `max`, `min` and `sum` are especially susceptible to this
3.  **Bad** Comments
    *   Comments are condiments for code; a small amount can enhance a meal, but too much ruins it
    *   Strive to write clear, self-documenting code that speaks for itself; when a line needs an explanatory comment to be understood, it indicates that identifier names were poorly chosen
    *   Delete obsolete remarks that no longer accurately describe the situation
    *   The same goes for blocks of commented-out code that serve no purpose and clutter up the file
    *   Programmers sometimes vent their frustration with snarky or vulgar comments; these add no value, are unprofessional and embarrassing, and only serve to demoralize maintainers
4.  **Too many** arguments
    *   Seen when more than a handful of parameters are passed to a function/method
    *   Parameters that are passed in but never used
5.  Function/Method that is **too long**
    *   Too many lines of code typically happens because the function/method has too many different responsibilities
    *   Generally, a method longer than a dozen lines should make you ask yourself these questions
        *   "Does one function really need to do all of this work?"
        *   "Could I split this into smaller, more focused pieces?"
6.  **Redundant** code
    *   A repeated statement which doesn't have an effect the second time
    *   Ask yourself whether it makes any difference to be run more than once
    *   ```python
        i = 7
        print(i)
        i = 7
        ```
7.  Decision tree that is **too complex**
    *   Too long or deeply nested trees of `if/elif/else`
    *   Are all of the branches truly necessary?
    *   Can all branches even be reached?
    *   Has every branch been tested?
8.  **Spaghetti** code
    *   Heaps of meandering code without a clear goal
    *   Functions/objects used in inconsistent ways
    *   Many variables are used to keep track of
    *   Conditional statements with long, confusing Boolean expressions
    *   Boolean expressions expressing double negatives; ex. `if not undone: ...`
    *   Code that makes you say "It would be easier to rewrite this than to understand it"
9.  **Dead** code
    *   Modules that are imported but not used
    *   Variables that are declared but not used
    *   Lines that are *never* run because they are placed in an impossible-to-reach location
        *   Code that appears after a `return` statement
            *   ```python
                return value
                value += 1
                ```
        *   Blocks of code guarded by an impossible-to-satisfy logical test
            *   ```python
                two_bee = True
                if two_bee and not two_bee:
                    print("If can you see this message, it is time to get a new CPU")
                ```
            *   ```python
                counter = 100
                while counter < 0:
                    print(f"T minus {counter}...")
                    counter -= 1
                ```
    *   Functions that are defined but never called *may* or *may not* be dead code
        *   In **Code Libraries** it is normal to define functions that are not meant to be used in the library itself
            *   It is okay to keep these functions
        *   As an **Application** evolves, calls to some of its functions may be removed until only the function's definition remains
            *   Some programmers may keep these functions "just in case" they are needed again
            *   We don't do this at DuckieCorp because we have Git; if we ever need to recover that function, we can find it in the repo's history


### Template

0.  Smell at `file` [lines xx-yy or general location]
    *   [Brief description of smell]
    *   [Code Snippet between triple-backquotes `` ``` ``]
    *   [How to resolve]


### Example

0.  Redundant Code at `src/main.py` [lines 28, 30]
    *   The import statement `import mbrot_fractal` occurs twice.  A second occurrence doesn't do it better than the first
    *   ```python
        import mbrot_fractal
        import phoenix_fractal as phoenix
        import mbrot_fractal
        ```
    *   Remove the second `import` statement



## Code Smells Report

0.  Dead code at `src/mbrot_fractal.py`
    *   At the top of the file there several `import` statements that are never used throughout the file
    *   ```python
        import sys
        import time
        ...
        from math import sqrt, cos, cosh, sin, sinh, remainder, acos, acosh, asin, asinh
        ...
        import turtle
        import os
        import os.path
        ... 
        import math
        ```
    *   Remove the unnecessary `import` statements
1.  Redundant code at `src/phoenix_fractal.py`
    *   On lines 170-176 the line `tk_Interface_PhotoImage_canvas_pixel_object.pack()` is called twice, with the second call not having an effect a second time
    *   ```python
        tk_Interface_PhotoImage_canvas_pixel_object.pack()  # Does this even matter?
        # At this scale, how much length and height of the
        # imaginary plane does one pixel cover?
        size = abs(max[0] - min[0]) / s

        # pack the canvas object into its parent widget
        tk_Interface_PhotoImage_canvas_pixel_object.pack()
        ```
      *   Remove the second `tk_Interface_PhotoImage_canvas_pixel_object.pack()` statement
2.  Too many arguments at `src/phoenix_fractal`
    *   On the line 131, when the `makePictureOfFractal` function is defined, there are 10 arguments, but only 5 of them are used
    *   ```python
        def makePictureOfFractal(f, i, e, w, g, p, W, a, b, s):
        ```
    *   Remove the unused arguments,`i, e, g, a, b` from the parameters of `makPictureOfFractal`
3.  Poorly named identifier at `src/phoenix_fractal`
    *   On lines 245-249, the developer set the identifier `len` as a function of `builtins`, so the original function of `len` is overrided
    *   ```python
        len = builtins.len
        if palette is None:
            return iter
        elif iter >= len(palette):
            iter = len(palette) - 1
        ```
    *   use `len()` in place of `builtins.len`
4.  Bad comment at `src/phoenix_fractal`
    *   On lines 181-186, the comment goes too much in-depth on how the `range()` function is used and how they use it
    *   ```python
        # for r (where r means "row") in the range of the size of the square image,
        # but count backwards (that's what the -1 as the 3rd parameter to the range() function means - it's the "step"
        # You can actually put any number there that you want, because it defaults to "1" you usually don't have to
        # but I have to here because we're actually going BACKWARDS, which took me
        # a long time to figure out, so don't change it, or else the picture won't
        # come out right 
        ```
    *   Simplify this comment and remove all the unneeded information
5.  Spaghetti code at `src/mbrot_fractal.py`
    *   On lines 43-66 there are many classes made to keep track of specific color hexadecimal numbers
    *   ```python
        class GRAPEFRUIT_PINK: c = '#E8283F'
        class LEMON: c = '#FDFF00'
        class LIME_GREEN: c = '#89FF00'
        class KUMQUAT:
            c = '#FAC309'
        class MAX_ITERATIONS: c = -1
        class POMELLO: c = '#2FFF00'
        class TANGERINE:
            c = '#F7B604'
        ...
        ```
    *   Delete the classes and put the hexadecimal numbers into the palette of `src/mbrot_fractal.py`
6.  Function too long at `src/phoenix_fractal`
    *   On lines 131-217 the function `makePictureOfFractal` fully creates the tkinter window and modifies it with the pixels to draw
    *   ```python
        # Compute the minimum coordinate of the picture
        min = ((f['centerX'] - (f['axisLength'] / 2.0)),
               (f['centerY'] - (f['axisLength'] / 2.0)))
        ...
        # Compute the maximum coordinate of the picture
        # The program has only one axisLength because the images are square
        # Squares are basically rectangles except the sides are equal instead of different
        max = ((f['centerX'] + (f['axisLength'] / 2.0)),
               (f['centerY'] + (f['axisLength'] / 2.0)))
        ...
        # Display the image on the screen
        tk_Interface_PhotoImage_canvas_pixel_object = Canvas(win, width=s, height=s, bg=W)
        ```
    *   Create a function that creates and prepares the tkinter window so that another function can focus on getting color based off of their complex numbers
7.  Decision tree is too complex at `src/mbrot_fractal` 
    *   On lines 334-374 there a couple decision trees that can be simplified into one line rather than multiple checking one item at a time
    *   ```python
        if 'centerX' not in frac:  # check for erros
            f.close()
            raise RuntimeError("A required parameter is missing")
        if 'centerY' not in frac:
            f.close()
            raise RuntimeError("A required parameter is missing")

        if 'type' in frac and not ('type' in frac):
            raise RuntimeError("A required parameter is missing")
            f.close
        ```
    *   check for each value with one `if` statement
8.  Unnescesary global variables at `mbrot_fractal.py`
    *   On lines 108-110, there are 3 global variables that are used but are only used in one function or get their value replaced
    *   ```python
        z = 0
        seven = 7.0
        TWO = 2
        ```
    *   Delete these variables, use `7.0` and `2` when needed in functions, then create `z` when needed to the fractal equations
9.  Magic numbers at `src/mbrot_fractal.py`
    *   On lines 120-121 there are 2 variables that use the number `512` but no comment explaining what `512` represents
    *   ```python
        portion = (512 - rows) / 512
        pixels = (512 - rows) * 512
        ```
    *   Add a comment explaining what `512` represents
10. Magic numbers at `src/mbrot_fractal.py`
    *   On lines 283-285 the number `512` is used to iterate in 2 `for` loops without anu context as to why `512` is used
    *   ```python
        for row in range(512, 0, -1):
            cc = []
            for col in range(512):
        ```
    *   Add a comment explaining what `512` represents and/or create a variable that has a name that describes its purpose, such as `pixels`
11. Poorly named identifiers at `src/phoenix_fractal`
    *   On line 190 there is a new list created called `cs`, but this name doesn't describe it's purpose
    *   ```python
        cs = []
        ```
    *   Rename the list to `row_pixel_colors` or something that describes it purpose in holding the pixel color for every pixel in a row
